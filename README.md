# @polkadot/dev

A collection of shared CI scripts and development environment (configuration, dependencies) used by @polkadot projects. It aims to reduce the boilerplate and updates needed to perform building or libraries as well as a one-repository for [flow definitions](https://flow.org/) for 3rd-party libraries.
